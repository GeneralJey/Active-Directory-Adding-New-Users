# Adding-New-Users-Computers


<h1>Adding-New-Users-Computers</h1>




<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of vulnerability scanning and vulnerability remediation. These are two of the main steps in the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle. I will be using Nessus Essentials to scan local VMs hosted on VMWare Workstation in order to run credentialed scans to discover vulnerabilities, remediate some of the vulnerabilities, then perform a rescan to verify remediation.
